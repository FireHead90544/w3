Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables you to build fast, user-friendly web applications. By combining Next.js with TypeScript, you can write strongly-typed code that is easier to maintain and less prone to errors. In this blog post, we'll walk through setting up a Next.js project with TypeScript and React.

### Why Choose Next.js?

#### Key Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Next.js makes it easy to render pages on the server, which can significantly improve performance and SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: You can pre-render pages at build time, offering a performance boost and enhanced SEO.
- **API Routes**: Next.js allows you to create API endpoints, which can be used to handle form submissions, fetch data, or build full-stack applications.
- **Built-in CSS Support**: Style your application using plain CSS, Sass, or styled-components.

#### Why TypeScript?

TypeScript brings static typing to JavaScript, making your code more predictable and easier to debug. With TypeScript, you can catch errors at compile-time, leading to a smoother development experience.


### Getting Started

To start a new project, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --ts my-nextjs-app
```

This will create a new Next.js project with TypeScript support out of the box.

#### Project Structure

Here's a quick look at the default project structure:

```
my-nextjs-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _app.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

The `pages/` directory is where you define your application's routes, while `tsconfig.json` handles TypeScript configuration.


### Writing Your First Component

Let's create a simple React component in TypeScript:

```Component.tsx
import React from 'react';

const HelloWorld: React.FC = () => {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
};

export default HelloWorld;
```

This component uses the `React.FC` type, which stands for "Function Component." It's a simple way to type a functional component in TypeScript.


### Deploying Your Application

Next.js applications can be easily deployed on Vercel, the creators of Next.js. Simply push your project to a GitHub repository, and import it into Vercel. Vercel automatically detects Next.js projects and handles the deployment process for you.

{<img center={"true"} src={"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d986caff-7642-40dc-a389-09c771e95f82"} width={512} alt={"hello?"} />}


### Conclusion

With Next.js, TypeScript, and React, you can build robust and scalable web applications quickly and efficiently. Whether you're building a simple static site or a complex full-stack application, this stack provides the tools you need to succeed.
